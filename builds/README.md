  <h3 align="center">Custom Docker Builds</h3>

  <p>
    For those that love the versitility of Docker and enjoy having an environment outside of your Operating System.  Using Docker allows me to keep my computer clean, provides versitility and portablility for images, and easy connectivity to preferred tools.  I tried to make sure that each image had three main things:
    <ul>
      <li>Accessible via SSH.</li>
      <li>Shared folder directory so that modifying application files is simple.</li>
      <li>Simple instructions on how to get the image running.</li>
  </p>
